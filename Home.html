            <div id="AboutParaDiv">
                <p>Ever since my parents purchased our first household computer, all aspects of the digital frontier have intrigued me. As I grew up, my fascination with computers became much deeper. I began to move away from simply using the computer and delved into learning how they worked. After countless hours of tinkering with and fixing my computer, I realized that I could learn to make my own software. This realization led me to the decision to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I am currently living down in Monroe, Louisiana where I work at CenturyLink as a Software Developer. Before that I worked in downtown Chicago as a Technical Specialist for a British Software company that specializes in OCR technology. In 2012, received my Bachelor&#8217s of Science degree in Computer Science from St. John&#8217;s University in Queens, New York. While attending St. John&#8217s, I worked as the Business Manager for The Torch, the school&#8217s award-winning student newspaper, for my sophomore and junior years. I am currently looking for an junior or mid level Software Engineering position and am willing to relocate if necessary. I would like to join an organization that offers strong opportunities for personal growth and advancement.</p>
                <p>Beyond programming, I also play the guitar, enjoy working out and personal fitness, and love to kick back with a great video game. I recently released an Android application called Iron Archive which can be downloaded for free from Amazon. I&#8217m a hard working and self-motivated individual who constantly seeks out ways to get my tasks accomplished in the most efficient manner possible.</p>
