<h1>About Me</h1>
<div>
<p>I recently received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from St. John's University in Queens, New York.  While attending St. John's, I worked as the Business Manager for The Torch, which is the student newspaper, for my sophomore and junior years.  I am currently looking for an entry level Software Engineering position and am willing to relocate if necessary.  I would like to join an organization that offers opportunity for personal growth and advancement.</p>

<p>Ever since my parents bought me my first computer, I have had an interest in computers.  As I became older I spent more time playing with my computer as well as fixing it, I acquired a deeper understanding of how computers work.  Eventually, I learned that I could make my own software.  It is because of this that I decided to go to college and get a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Other than programming, some other things I enjoy are video games, working out at the gym, traveling, watching television, playing guitar and gourmet cooking.  I constantly look for ways to get my assigned tasks done faster and more efficiently.  I was born in 1990 in Silver Springs, Maryland but I currently live in Hinsdale, Illinois.
